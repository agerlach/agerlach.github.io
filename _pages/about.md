<!-- About Me
====== -->

I am a researcher and engineer at the Air Force Research Laboratory whose primary interests lie in pushing the boundaries of next-generation technologies.  I have had the privilege of leading multidisciplinary and international teams of engineers, researchers, and designers. My technical experience spans diverse industries, including defense, space, robotics, software, and healthcare. My current work is focused on extending the real-world applicability of autonomous systems in complex environments through advancements in planning and decision making under uncertain and incomplete information. 

I strive to develop impactful and lasting solutions, whether they are elegant in their simplicity or sophisticated in their complexity. The real-world impact of my work has been recognized numerous times by my leadership and peers through various [awards and recognitions](/awards) including multiple Innovation Awards. To learn more about my career I invite you to see my [curriculum vitae](/files/cv.pdf).

Beyond my work with advanced technologies, I find balance in simple and traditional activities. I enjoy handtool woodworking, leathercrafting, bushcrafting, rucking, and, most importantly, spending time with my family.
